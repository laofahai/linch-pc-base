# Contributing to Linch Base

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Linch Base as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes to the project, you assign the copyright on the code to us (along with the original copyright holder), but the code is still licensed under the MIT License.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/linch-tech/linch-pc-base/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
